Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The goals of my application were to make sure that users were able to login, and once that they have logged in, be able to make changes to the inventory application. Some of these changes include, adding and deleting items from the inventory database and having the option of getting SMS text messaging when certain inventory items are running low. 


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  The screens that were needed for this application started out with the login screen, in this screen users will be asked to login with a username and password. If the user is new, they will be able to make a new account with the new user button on the bottom of the page. Once the user is logged in, they will be directed to a screen where they will be able to add items to the data base. This screen was the one where I was most proud of the design. I had an idea of how I wanted it to look, and I think it is simple and easy to navigate that I was looking for and I beleive that in any app, ease of use is most important and I think these screen layouts depict that 



How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  Zybooks and the Andriod Development site really helped me create the login screen. From this information I was able to see how to use databases and really create an app from the gorund up. Having exsamples to look at like the ones in our readings gives us the confidence to create it in our own unqiue way. 



How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Useing a debugger is essential in everyhting that ive done so far throughout this program, having somthing that is able to identify problems specifically, leads me in where I need to go to fix the problem. In andriod studio this is a tedious process, there are some warnings that I found out you really can get rid of. 



Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Most of the steps where set up for us week by week with the things that we should be looking for in an application, this included making the activities needed for a user to navigate an applicaiton. I really just took it step by step and just focused on one button and UI screen at a time. Creating an application as we know now, can be a daunting experiance, but having patience is a skill that need to be learned to power through hard situations. 



In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I really liked the overall layout and color scheme of the application. I beleive that it is easy on the eyes (and phone battery as well) and easy to navigate. If this application were to be realeased and used in the real world, I have no doubt that someone with no experiance in inventory could figure this application out.
